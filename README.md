A wrapper for the [Spore API](http://www.spore.com/comm/samples) that simplifies and complements its functionality

# Features
- JSON instead of XML
- WebSocket Radio (Coming soon...)
- SporePedia (Coming soon...)
- WikiPedia[eng only] (Comins soon...)

## How is the wrapper different from the original api?
It's okay that you ask this question (to be honest, I would ask myself). There are not many differences at the moment, but in the future there will be many innovations listed above.
